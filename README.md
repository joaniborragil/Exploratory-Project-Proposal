# Exploratory-Project-Proposal
# A description of what your final product will be. What will it do? 
This project will be a soccer simulation game, where the user can control a soccer ball by dragging and aiming it, then releasing it to make a shot at a goal. The ball will bounce off the walls, and the player needs to try to get the ball into the goal to score a point. The game will track the player's score and display it on the screen.

The ball will respond to the user's input for direction and strength, mimicking a real soccer shot. The goal will be located at one end of the canvas, and when the ball enters the goal area, the score will increment. A message will also appear to notify the player that they need to get the ball into the goal, lasting for five seconds.I would like to learn how to make the "computer play against you" by adding a fake player that competes against you. In addition, I would love to make the goal move constantly to make it more difficult for the player. 
Features:
1. Ball is controlled by dragging and aiming.

2. The ball bounces off the edges of the screen.

3. A goal area that the player tries to shoot the ball into.

4. Score tracking and display.

5. An instructional message that shows for five seconds after the game starts.

6. A description of the things you want to learn by doing this project.

7. Learn how to add a bot that competes against the player

8. Make the goal constantly move so it is more of a challenge for the player.


# A description of the things you want to learn by doing this project.

Through this soccer simulation game, I aim to improve my understanding of game mechanics, particularly in the context of physics and interactivity. Specifically, I want to learn how to:

1. Implement AI for a Bot Player: I am interested in learning how to create a computer-controlled player (bot) that competes against the human player. This will involve AI principles like decision-making, pathfinding, and potentially making the bot adapt to the player's actions.

2. Add Dynamic Elements for Increased Difficulty: One of my goals is to make the game more challenging by making the goal area move around the screen. I want to figure out how to move the goal in a way that increases difficulty without making the game too frustrating.

3. Enhance User Experience with Interactive Features: I want to learn how to add dynamic features like the 5-second instructional message that guides the player and adds a sense of progression to the game. This involves controlling timing and display elements.

4. Refine Physics Simulations: I want to better understand how to implement realistic movement and collision detection in games, especially in relation to how the ball bounces off walls and reacts to user input. This will help improve my understanding of real-time physics simulation in a game environment.

5. Game State Management: I plan to explore how to effectively track and display the game state, including scoring, game progress, and the condition of the game (e.g., whether the ball is in motion, if the goal has been scored, etc.).
